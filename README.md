# Drone-IQ
Repository for the Autonomous Drone project from COSMOS 2024-2025 Cluster 2.

CODE ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Not all files are required for the processing of images. Look into main.py to check which ones are necessary.
- It is important you download all of the libraries found throughout the .py files
- You might need to setup an environment with tensorflow in order to use our files. (Python 3.11 or below)
- We split up the code files into three main sections, but it is fine if you have it all under one comprehensive environment.
- Our .h5 model is too large to be pushed to Github, so we included it seperately down below:
- www.kaggle.com/datasets/nnishio/building-outlines-for-segmentation
- Aside from just downloading libraries, you MUST change your file paths in main.py.

FUTURE CHALLENGES:
- In case there are any questions or challenges you have, feel free to shoot us an email.
